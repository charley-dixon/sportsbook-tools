    <h1>The House Always Wins</h1>
    <p>
      This site contains a collection of tools that I built to assist in making informed bets on sporting events. The tools on their own are useful, but together they create a framework for researching a matchup thoroughly. They are intended to be navigated sequentially like so:
      <ol>
        <li>Identify a matchup that may contain good betting opportunities</li>
        <li>Compare the raw numbers of each team in a vacuum</li>
        <li>Make adjustments to your view of the raw numbers based on the existential circumstances surrounding a game (i.e. is it a big game? Will one team have more to play for than the other? What will the weather be? etc.)</li>
        <li>Log your results</li>
        <li>Learn from your mistakes</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
