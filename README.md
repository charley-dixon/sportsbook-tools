# Sportsbook Tools

This site contains a collection of tools that I built to assist in making informed bets on sporting events.

## Tools
* [Odds Converter](#odds-converter)
* [Information Aggregator](#information-aggregator)
* [Bet Tracker](#bet-tracker)


### Odds Converter

I like to use decimal odds, but most sports books use American odds. It's nice for me to have a quick way to flip back and forth between the two.


### Information Aggregator

Will utilize XHR to make http requests to multiple websites and compile them into one concise web page.


### Bet Tracker

Will be able to parse images of screenshots that I provide to keep track of the bets I make. Over time it will create a filterable list various time periods to visualize graphs of my performance over time.

Filters:
* Bet Type (Prop vs. not prop?) (Spread, total, prop, etc.)
* Time Period (Beginning & Ending Dates)
* Sport (NFL, NBA, NCAAF, etc.)
* Unit (hidden from public view)
* Result of Bet (W/L/Push)
